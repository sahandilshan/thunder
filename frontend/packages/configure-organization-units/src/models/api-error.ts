/**
 * Standard API Error Structure

 * @public
 * @remarks
 * This structure is used for error handling in API responses.
 * The `code` field contains a machine-readable error identifier,
 * while `message` and `description` provide human-readable details.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const error: ApiError = {
 *   code: 'OU-60001',
 *   message: 'Organization unit not found',
 *   description: 'No organization unit exists with the given ID'
 * };
 * ```
 */
export interface ApiError {
  /**
   * Machine-readable error code
   * @example 'OU-60001'
   */

  /**
   * Short error message
   * @example 'Organization unit not found'
   */
  message: string;

  /**
   * Detailed error description
   * @example 'No organization unit exists with the given ID'
   */
